natwest-balancer
================

Natwest balancer is an attempt to get some useful data out of the not-so-helpful NatWest csv.

The plan is to be able to import a CSV which will update the local database and you will be able to get useful stats like an actual statement, sorting charges by type etc.

The app is being developed on QtQuick so possible Android and iPhone versions are not out of the question.
